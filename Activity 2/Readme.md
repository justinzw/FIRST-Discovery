## Activity 2

In this Activity, we'll continue with what we've learned in Activity 1 with Face Detection, and add Face recognition to our abilities. Facial recognition requires Misty to be 'trained' on a persons face so she can itentify them later on. To get started, open up Activity2.html, and pick a person to train misty on by entering their name, and clicking 'Train'. Then you can have Misty watch for people she recognizes! Be sure to look at mistyCode.js and try changing the sounds Misty uses when she recoginizes people!

## What to look for
- You'll trigger actions with Activity2.html
- You can change how Misty behaves using JavaScript in mistyCode.js
- Try changing what sounds Misty plays when she recognizes certain people!
