## Activity 3

This activilty will build on what was learned in Activity 2, with the introduction of some movement when a person is recognized. You'll notice that we've added some additional 'knownPerson' variables in mistyCode.js as well as a switch statement where you can customize how misty reacts to specific people 

As in the previous activity, open up the Activity3.html file in a web browser, connect to your robot, and under the 'Watch for people Misty Likes' click start to have misty watch for those who she knows!


The default action when Misty recognizes someone is to play a sound and spin in a cirlce. What can you get Misty to do?
