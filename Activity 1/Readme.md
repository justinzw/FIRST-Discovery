## Activity 1

In this Activity, we'll start with the basics of face detection. We'll introduce some basic JavaScript code that connects to the robot, opens a web socket to get data from Misty, then Misty will play a specified sound when she sees someones face. Test out the code then try changing which sound Misty play when she sees someone!

To Get started, open up the Activity1.html file in a web browser like Chrome, connect to your robot with the IP address of your robot (which can be found via the Companion App or will be provided), and click 

## What to look for
- You'll trigger actions with Activity1.html
- You can change how Misty behaves using JavaScript in mistyCode.js
- If you'd like, you can change the style of Activity1.html with style.css
